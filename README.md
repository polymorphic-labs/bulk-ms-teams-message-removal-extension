# bulk-ms-teams-message-removal-extension
Delete Teams messages in bulk.
## ATTENTION:
If you are an admin user, ie. Global Administrator, you can delete other people's messages in any channels. By default, however, that capability is turned off. To enable admin's broader message deleting permission, please following the [instructions](#visit-the-microsoft-teams-admin-center) below. No one can delete other people's chat (DM) messages even if you are an admin.

## Usage Instructions
